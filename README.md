A Tic-Tac-Toe program that I thought would be an interesting way to learn various programming concepts.

Eventually I expect it to have a clean-looking board, with a helpful menu. I plan to have many settings such as the number of tiles on the board, which players are human, and possibly a way to change the difficulty. I will hope to add clear documentation and ant build scripts for developers, as well as a jar executable for portability.

This project may not be updated frequently, depending on how busy I am with school work.
